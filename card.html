			<p>The non-flying penguin (yes, the cute ones from <em>Happy Feet</em>) are the joy of the South Pole - unfortunately, they are some of the most endangered species on the planet, largely due to human interference. Their plumage is black and white, and they use their flippers to swim, making them one of the most unique birds in existence.</p>
